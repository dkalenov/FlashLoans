# Crypto Trading Execution with Flash Loans, Web3 and Hardhat

## Project objectives
Reduce risk on arbitrage with Uniswap and PancakeSwap Flash Swap smart contracts. Learn to interact with the blockchain.

## Project description
I am studying Crypto Trading Execution with Flash Loans, Web3, and Hardhat. This course focuses on reducing risk in trading on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchain networks using Flash Loans via the Flash Swaps functions on the Uniswap and PancakeSwap Smart Contracts.

## Key Concepts:
Flash Loans: Mechanism for borrowing capital must be paid back within the same transaction, allowing you to keep arbitrage gains if successful.
Smart Contracts: Programming, deploying, reading, writing, and interacting with Smart Contracts on the blockchain using Ethers JS and Hardhat.
Programming Languages: Modules on interacting with Smart Contracts using Python and Javascript.
Course Highlights:
Deep dive into Flash Loan/Flash Swap Smart Contracts.
Hands-on experience in programming and deploying Smart Contracts.
Practical demonstration of trading using Flash Loans.
Crash course in Solidity, Python, and Javascript for beginners.

## Tasks
Build Flash Loan (Flash Swap) Smart Contracts for arbitrage across multiple exchanges.
Perform a triangular arbitrage Flash Loan (Flash Swap) transaction on PancakeSwap.
Write and test Flash Loan Smart Contracts using Hardhat.
Develop a trading algorithm to read data and transact swaps in Python.
Read and write data to the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains.
Send and check transactions via Web3.
Use Ethers JS for interacting with Smart Contracts.
Calculate gas used on transactions.
Deploy Smart Contracts to the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Status:
Developing and testing Flash Loan Smart Contracts and trading algorithms for arbitrage opportunities.
